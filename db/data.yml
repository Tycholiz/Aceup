    - I hate to break it to you, but what people call 'love' is just a chemical reaction
      that compels animals to breed. It hits hard Morty then it slowly fades leaving
      you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are going to do it.
      Break the cycle Morty, rise above, focus on science.

      understand? Stop looking at me like that and actually help me. Help me. Help
      me I'm gunna die.
